Hello readers of the world and thanks for coming by!

So this is my initial blog post on this website, as all blog websites should have.

I always wanted to create a personal blog like this, but was always reluctant to do so, and after some time I finally worked on it.

I won't try to act like I did a lot of effort, since this blog was made with the help of this [template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), so huge props to the developer for that!

Why do I bother making this whole blog thing? when I can just write stuff on other platform like Medium?

Well, some reasons, basically I wanted to control the style and text of the blog like having cool math typesetting such as $\LaTeX$ and other stuff, besides that, isn't it kinda cool having your own personal blog website?

So yeah, I'm planning to write some stuff here mainly on programming and maths, but it could be some random things as well.

If you are curious on learning programming and maths you might benefit from my blogs (hopefully), so stay tune!
