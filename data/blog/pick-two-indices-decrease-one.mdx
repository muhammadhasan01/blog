## Problem Statement

I've been pondering about this problem for quite some time and wanted to share some insights about this problem.

Given $n$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n$ $(n \geq 2)$, you can do the following operation:

1. Choose two different indices $i$ and $j$ $(1 \leq i, j \leq n, i \neq j)$
2. Decrease $a_i$ and $a_j$ by $1$

Determine whether you can make all $a_i=0$ where $1 \leq i \leq n$ doing a number of operations.

Furthermore, can you list out the operations as well if it is possible?

Think about this problem for a while, before moving on down this blog :)

We can also extend this problem to some extend, like making all the integers the same with minimum number of operation.

You can try out this problem similar to this:

- [CodeForces - 1201B - Zero Array](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1201/B)
- [LeetCode - Weekly Contest 396 - Minimum Cost to Equalize Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-equalize-array/description/)

## Insights

Let's look at some observations, let $S$ be the sum of all the integers that is:

$$
S=\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i
$$

Doing one operations means decreasing $S$ by $2$, furthermore the parity (odd/even) of $S$ will never change, this is called an [Invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics))

That means if $S$ is odd from the beginning then we cannot make all integers into zero as zero is even.

Okay, now we know that $S$ must be even, but this is not enough to solve the problem.

Let's try to think in reverse, given $n$ zeros ($a_i = 0$ where $1 \leq i \leq n$), can we choose two different indices $i, j$ and increase $a_i$ and $a_j$ by $1$ such that it will result in the original array?

Doing the reversed problem will give us some insights.

Let suppose we choose an index $k$ $(1 \leq k \leq n)$ and we always pick $k$ every time we do an operation, what would we have?

We could see all the sum of all other integers will result in $a_k$ and here on if we try to make any operation outside $k$ then we would have that $a_k \leq S-a_k$.

From here, we can make a **claim** that for every integer $a_i$ then $a_i$ is less or equal to the sum of the other indices.

To make it more simple, we can claim that the maximum integer in all of $a_i$ must be less or equal to the sum of all the other integers.

We can prove the above claim using [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction) by using the observation above.

It turns out that this is all enough to solve the problem, that is:

1. The sum of all integers is even
2. The maximum integer is less than or equal to the sum of all other integers

To get all the operations, one of the way is to always choose the maximum integer and minimum integer.

## Bonus (Code)

```cpp
void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n ; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    int sum = accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0);
    if (sum % 2 == 1) {
        cout << -1 << '\n';
        return;
    }
    int mx = *max_element(a.begin(), a.end());
    if (sum - mx < mx) {
        cout << -1 << '\n';
        return;
    }
    vector<pair<int, int>> operations;
    set<pair<int, int>> st;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        st.emplace(a[i], i);
    }
    while (!st.empty()) {
        int i = st.begin()->second;
        int j = prev(st.end())->second;
        operations.emplace_back(i, j);
        st.erase({a[i], i});
        st.erase({a[j], j});
        a[i]--;
        a[j]--;
        if (a[i] > 0) {
            st.emplace(a[i], i);
        }
        if (a[j] > 0) {
            st.emplace(a[j], j);
        }
    }
    cout << operations.size() << '\n';
    for (auto [i, j] : operations) {
        cout << i << ' ' << j << '\n';
    }
}
```
