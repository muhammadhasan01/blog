This is a continuation of the previous blog about [Euler's Totient Function](https://blog.mhasan01.com/blog/euler-totient-function), let's discuss the Euler's Theorem, yet again, it's definition and proof.

## Definition

Let $n$ and $a$ be a positive integers such that they are relatively prime, i.e. $\mathrm{gcd}(a, n) = 1$, then:

$$
a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } n)
$$

Where $\phi(n)$ is Euler's Totient Function.


## Proof

There are famously two known proofs here, a direct argument involving multiplying all the elements together, and the other uses a [group theory](https://brilliant.org/wiki/group-theory-introduction/), we'll only discuss the first proof here.

First of all, we will use the notation $(\mathbb{Z}/n)^*$, which is the set in the definition of $\phi(n)$, consisting positive integers $\leq n$ which are relatively prime to $n$, formally:

$$

(\mathbb{Z}/n)^* = \{x \in \mathbb{N}: 1 \leq x \leq n, \mathrm{gcd}(n, x) = 1\}

$$

So $\phi(n) = |(\mathbb{Z}/n)^*|$.

Consider the elements $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{\phi(n)}$ of $(\mathbb{Z}/n)^*$.

**Claim**: for $a \in (\mathbb{Z}/n)^*$,
multiplication by $a$ makes it into a permutation of this set, that is the set $\{ax_1, ax_2, \dots, ax_{\phi(n)}\}$ equals to $(\mathbb{Z}/n)^*$.

The claim is true, because the multiplication by $a$ is a function from the finite set $(\mathbb{Z}/n)^*$ to itself **has an inverse**, which is the multiplication by $a^{-1} \ (\text{mod } n)$.

For instance, let $n=10$ then we will have:

$$
(\mathbb{Z}/n)^* = \{1, 3, 7, 9\}
$$

Multiplication by $a=3$ where $a \in (\mathbb{Z}/n)^*$ turns it into $\{3, 9, 1, 7\}$ which is permutes the element of the set. Also, multiplication by $7 = 3^{-1} \ (\text{mod } 10)$ is the inverse of this permutation.

Now, given the claim, consider the product of all the elements in $(\mathbb{Z}/n)^*$.

On one hand it is $\prod_{i=1}^{\phi(n)} x_i$, and on the other hand, it is $\prod_{i=1}^{\phi(n)} (ax_i)$, both products are congruent modulo $n$.

So we will have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\prod_{i=1}^{\phi(n)} x_i &\equiv \prod_{i=1}^{\phi(n)} (ax_i) \\
\prod_{i=1}^{\phi(n)} x_i &\equiv a^{\phi(n)} \prod_{i=1}^{\phi(n)} x_i \\
1 &\equiv a^{\phi(n)}
\end{aligned}
$$

where cancellation of the $x_i$ is allowed because they all have multiplication inverse modulo $n$. $_{\Box}$
