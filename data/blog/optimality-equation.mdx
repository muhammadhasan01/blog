## Optimal Allocation

Going to an extreme (all-in on one side) is rarely the winning move.

But it's not always about being "perfectly balanced" either.

Real progress is about **optimal allocation** under constraints.

### A simple equation (Quality × Quantity)

Let $\text{quality} = x$ and $\text{quantity} = y$.

Assume you have a fixed budget of energy or time. Example:

$$
x + y = 100
$$

Define your total output as the product of the two:

$$
\text{output} = xy
$$

A few concrete points:

- $x=90,\,y=10 \rightarrow \text{output}=900$ (Perfectionism, low volume)
- $x=60,\,y=40 \rightarrow \text{output}=2400$
- $x=50,\,y=50 \rightarrow \text{output}=2500$ **(Maximum Output)**
- $x=20,\,y=80 \rightarrow \text{output}=1600$
- $x=0,\,y=100 \rightarrow \text{output}=0$ (Spamming garbage)

Extremes fail here. Pushing $x$ too high forces $y$ too low, and the product drops.

Since $y = 100 - x$, output becomes a function of $x$:

$$
f(x) = x(100-x) = 100x - x^2
$$

Setting the derivative to zero $\left(f'(x) = 100 - 2x = 0\right)$ gives us $x=50$.

Meaning: **if output is $xy$ (weights are equal), an equal split is optimal**.

## Raising the base

If you want both quality and quantity to increase, you can't do it while $x+y=100$.
You have to increase the base constraints:

$$
x+y=B \quad \Rightarrow \quad B \uparrow \Rightarrow x \uparrow \text{ and } y \uparrow
$$

This is what "improvement" really is. You aren't just reallocating effort; you are **expanding the budget** through better tools, higher leverage, or skill acquisition.

## When quality matters more

In the real world, quality often carries more weight than quantity. We model this by adding an exponent:

$$
\text{output} = x^2y,\quad x+y=100
$$

Here, quality ($x$) is squared, making it "twice as important" as quantity ($y$).

Substitute $y=100-x$ and differentiate:

$$
f(x) = x^2(100-x) = 100x^2 - x^3
$$

$$
f'(x) = 200x - 3x^2 = x(200 - 3x)
$$

Setting this to zero gives the critical point:

$$
x=\frac{200}{3} \approx 66.7
$$

$$
y \approx 33.3
$$

Notice the ratio:

$$
x = 2y
$$

Because quality was squared $\left(x^2\right)$ and quantity was linear $\left(y^1\right)$, the optimal allocation is a **$2:1$ split**. The math mirrors the priority.

It is not "balanced" (50/50), but it is **optimal**.

## More than 2 variables

Real life has many levers:

$$
x+y+z = B
$$

The principle holds:
1.  **Don't maximize one variable** at the expense of zeroing out the others.
2.  **Align allocation with impact.** If $x$ has the highest exponent (impact), allocate the most resources there, but do not neglect $y$ and $z$.
