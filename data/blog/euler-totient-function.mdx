I am long fascinated by Euler's Totient Function, and so I wanted to write it here and share about it. Let's discuss the definition, use cases, and some proofs.

# Definition

Euler's totient function (also called the Phi function denoted with the $\phi$ symbol or $\varphi$ symbol) for a positive integer $n$, counts the number of positive integers less than or equal $n$ that are coprime to $n$.[^1]

That is, for a positive integer $n$, $\phi(n)$ is the number of positive integer $x$ such that $1 \leq x \leq n$ and $\mathrm{gcd}(n, x) = 1$.

For example, we would have $\phi(10) = 4$ since there are $4$ numbers less than $10$ that is coprime with $10$ which are $(1, 3, 7, 9)$.

**Note**: we would have $\phi(1) = 1$ since the only positive integer less or equal to $1$ is $1$ and $\mathrm{gcd}(1, 1) = 1$.

# Use Cases

## Euler Theorem

Euler's Theorem states that:

Let $n$ and $a$ be a positive integers such that they are relatively prime, i.e. $\mathrm{gcd}(a, n) = 1$, then:

$$a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } n)$$

For example, let's try computing $2023^{2020} \ \text{mod } 10$.

Since $2023$ and $10$ are relatively prime, we will have:

$$2023^{\phi(10)} \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 10) \implies 2023^{4} \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 10)$$

Therefore we will have:

$$\left(2023^{4}\right)^{505} \equiv 1^{505} \ (\text{mod } 10) \implies 2023^{2020} \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 10)$$

So $2023^{2020} \ \text{mod } 10 = 1$.

## Divisor Sum

The property established by Gauss,[^2] is that:

$$\displaystyle \sum_{d | n}\phi(d) = n$$

where the sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.

For example: when $n = 10$, then we will have $\phi(1) + \phi(2) + \phi(5) + \phi(10) = 10$, which is true.

The formula can also be derived from elementary arithmetic.[^3]

Let's continue with the previous example, let $n=10$ and consider the positive fractions up to $1$ with denominator $10$:

$$\displaystyle \frac{1}{10}, \frac{2}{10}, \frac{3}{10}, \frac{4}{10}, \frac{5}{10}, \frac{6}{10}, \frac{7}{10}, \frac{8}{10}, \frac{9}{10}, \frac{10}{10}$$

Let's put them in their lowest term:

$$\displaystyle \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{3}{10}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{7}{10}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{9}{10}, \frac{1}{1}$$

Notice that for the denominator $10$ there are exactly $\phi(10) = 4$ fractions, e.g. $\displaystyle \frac{1}{10}, \frac{3}{10}, \frac{7}{10}, \frac{9}{10}$

More generally, for each denominator $x$ we will have there are $\phi(x)$ such fractions in the list above.

Thus the set of $10$ fractions is split into subsets of size $\phi(d)$ for each $d$ dividing $10$.

A similar argument applies for any $n$.

# Formula

For a positive integer $n$ let $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k$ be the distinct primes that divides $n$, then we will have:

$$\displaystyle \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1} \right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2} \right) \cdots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k} \right)$$

For example, we have for $n=10$ the primes that divides $n$ are $2$ and $5$ hence:

$$\displaystyle \phi(10) = 10 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{5} \right) = 4$$

For the proof of this formula, we need to know some important facts

### Phi is a multiplicative function

Let $n$ and $m$ be a coprime positive integer then we will have:

$$ \phi(nm) = \phi(n) \phi(m) $$

Proof for this fact is: Let $A, B, C$ be the set of integers which are coprime to $n$, $m$, and $nm$ respectively.

That is $\phi(n) = |A|$, $\phi(m) = |B|$, and $\phi(nm) = |C|$.

Then we need to proof that there is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection) between the set $A \times B$ and the set $C$.

In simpler terms, we need to proof that each element in $A \times B$ corresponds uniquely to an element in set $C$, and vice versa.

This is essentially CRT i.e. [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem) which states that if you have a system of modular congruences with relatively prime modulo (in this case, $n$ and $m$), then there exists a unique solution modulo the product of the modulo ($nm$).

If $a$ is coprime to $n$ and $b$ is coprime to $m$ this bijection sends $(a,b)$ to $c$ with $c$ coprime to $nm$ (Because $c$ has no divisor in common with $n$ or $m$).

Therefore there is a bijection between $A \times B$ with $C$

Thus having: $ \phi(nm) = |A| \times |B| = \phi(n) \phi(m) $

### Computing Phi with a prime power argument

Let $p$ be a prime number and $k \geq 1$, then we will have:

$$\displaystyle \phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} = p^k \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)$$

The proof for this is quite simple, the only way a positive integer $x \leq p$ having $\mathrm{gcd}(p, x) = 1$ is that $p$ does not divides $x$.

Therefore $x$ would not be in the set $\{p, 2p, \dots, p^{k-1}p\}$ which have $p^{k-1}$ numbers.

So $\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}$.

## Proof for Euler Totient's Function Formula

Now that we now some important facts, we can prove the Euler Totient's Function Formula.

Let $n$ be a positive integer, then we can represent $n$ using prime factorization as follows:

$$n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{a_k} $$

Where $p_i$ is prime nd $a_i$ is a positive integer for $1 \leq i \leq k$.

We can rewrite it as:

$$\displaystyle n = \prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{a_i} $$

Using the facts of **multiplicative function** and **phi with a prime power argument**, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}

\phi(n) &= \phi\left(\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{a_i}\right) \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^{k} \phi(p_i^{a_i}) \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^{k} \left( p_i^{a_i} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_i} \right) \right) \\
&= \left( \prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{a_i} \right) \left(\prod_{i=1}^{k} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_i} \right) \right) \\
&= n \left(\prod_{i=1}^{k} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_i} \right) \right) \\
&= n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1} \right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2} \right) \cdots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k} \right)

\end{aligned}
$$

## In Summary

We learn about Euler Totient's Function, it's definiton, use cases, and proofs. Thanks for reading up until here, I hope you learn something :D

## Bonus (Code)

Here are C++ implementations for computing Euler's Totient Function:

```cpp:euler-totient-function.cpp
int phi(int n) {
    int result = n;
    for (int p = 2; p * p <= n; p++) {
        if (n % p == 0) {
            while (n % p == 0) {
                n /= p;
            }
            result -= result / p;
        }
    }
    if (n > 1) {
        result -= result / n;
    }
    return result;
}
```

Or we can also precompute using similar to Sieve Eratosthenes Trick:

```cpp:precompute-phi.cpp
const int N = 100000;

vector<int> phi(N + 1);
for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    phi[i] = i;
}
for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
    if (phi[i] == i) {
        for (int j = i; j <= N; j += i) {
            phi[j] -= phi[j] / i;
        }
    }
}
```
