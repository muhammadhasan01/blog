I am long fascinated by Euler Theorem, and so I wanted to write it here and share about it. We'll discuss the definition, some proofs, and use cases.

The Euler Theorem states that:

Let $n$ and $a$ be a positive integers such that they are coprime, i.e. $\mathrm{gcd}(a, n) = 1$, then:

$$a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } n)$$

Where $\phi(n)$ is Euler Totient's Function.

Before we try to discuss the proof on this theorem, let's talk more about Euler Totient's Function first.

# Euler Totient Function

Euler's totient function (also called the Phi function denoted with the $\phi$ symbol or $\varphi$ symbol) for a positive integer $n$, counts the number of positive integers less than or equal $n$ that are coprime to $n$.

That is, for a positive integer $n$, $\phi(n)$ is the number of positive integer $x$ such that $1 \leq x \leq n$ and $\mathrm{gcd}(n, x) = 1$.

For example, we would have $\phi(10) = 4$ since there are $4$ numbers less than $10$ that is coprime with $10$ which are $(1, 3, 7, 9)$.

**Note**: we would have $\phi(1) = 1$ since the only positive integer less or equal to $1$ is $1$ and $\mathrm{gcd}(1, 1) = 1$.

## Formula

For a positive integer $n$ let $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k$ be the distinct primes that divides $n$, then we will have:

$$\displaystyle \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1} \right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2} \right) \cdots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k} \right)$$

For example, we have for $n=10$ the primes that divides $n$ are $2$ and $5$ hence:

$$\displaystyle \phi(10) = 10 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{5} \right) = 4$$

For the proof of this formula, we need to know some important facts

### Phi is a multiplicative function

Let $n$ and $m$ be a coprime positive integer then we will have:

$$ \phi(nm) = \phi(n) \phi(m) $$

Proof for this fact is: Let $A, B, C$ be the set of integers which are coprime to $n$, $m$, and $nm$ respectively.

That is $\phi(n) = |A|$, $\phi(m) = |B|$, and $\phi(nm) = |C|$.

Then we need to proof that there is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection) between the set $A \times B$ and the set $C$.

In simpler terms, we need to proof that each element in $A \times B$ corresponds uniquely to an element in set $C$, and vice versa.

This is essentially CRT i.e. [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem) which states that if you have a system of modular congruences with relatively prime modulo (in this case, $n$ and $m$), then there exists a unique solution modulo the product of the modulo ($nm$).

If $a$ is coprime to $n$ and $b$ is coprime to $m$ this bijection sends $(a,b)$ to $c$ with $c$ coprime to $nm$ (Because $c$ has no divisor in common with $n$ or $m$).

Therefore there is a bijection between $A \times B$ with $C$

Thus having: $ \phi(nm) = |A| \times |B| = \phi(n) \phi(m) $


### Computing Phi with a prime power argument

Let $p$ be a prime number and $k \geq 1$, then we will have:

$$\displaystyle \phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} = p^k \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)$$

The proof for this is quite simple, the only way having a positive integer $x$ having $\mathrm{gcd}(p, x) \neq 1$ is that $p$ divides $x$.

Therefore $x$ would be in the set $\{p, 2p, \dots, p^{k-1}p\}$ which have $p^{k-1}$ numbers.

So $\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}$.

## Proof for Euler Totient's Function Formula

Now that we now some important facts, we can prove the Euler Totient's Function Formula...
